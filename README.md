### Project Title
# Explore US Bikeshare Data with R

### Description
This project uses R to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”*Chicago*, *New York City*, and *Washington*.  

It imports raw data to answer interesting questions about the data by computing descriptive statistics and making visualizations.

### Statistics Computed
By computing a variety of descriptive statistics, this project provide the following information:

**1. Popular times of travel**
* most common month

**2. Popular stations and trip**
* most common start station

**3. Trip duration**
* average travel time

**4. Plots for the above questions**
* plots of most common month for each city
* plots of most common start station for each city
* plots of average travel time for each city

### Files used
In this project, I used data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.

The data files used are:
1. chicago.csv
2. new_york_city.csv
3. washington.csv

### Software used
* RStudio
* Jupyter
* Atom
- Terminal on Mac

### Credits
* This project is an assignment of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) [Programming for Data Science with Python](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd104/dashboard/overview).
* I was inspired by repo [create-your-own-adventure](https://github.com/udacity/create-your-own-adventure/blob/master/README.md) for README writing.  
- I checked [Markdown quick reference cheat sheet](https://wordpress.com/support/markdown-quick-reference/) for markdown reference.
