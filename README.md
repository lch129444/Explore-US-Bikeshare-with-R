### Project Title
# Explore US Bikeshare Data with R

### Description
This project uses R to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”*Chicago*, *New York City*, and *Washington*.  

It imports raw data to answer interesting questions about the data by computing descriptive statistics and making visualizations.

### Statistics Computed
By computing a variety of descriptive statistics, this project provide the following information:

**1. Popular times of travel**
* most common month

**2. Popular stations and trip**
* most common start station

**3. Trip duration**
* average travel time

**4. Plots for the above questions**
* plots of most common month for each city
* plots of most common start station for each city
* plots of average travel time for each city

### Files used
In this project, I used data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.

The data files used are:
1. chicago.csv
2. new_york_city.csv
3. washington.csv

### Software used
* RStudio
* Jupyter
* Atom
- Terminal on Mac

### Credits
* This project is an assignment of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) [Programming for Data Science with R](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd118/parts/b6a20e57-d477-45c8-9deb-5b87abe46bb3/modules/a94a948b-7d49-42bd-a9a2-f32493b99b65/lessons/cf989766-615b-48fc-b448-2fffeaccd072/concepts/d118d7d3-7b27-4871-b1ef-e4e50cfb0111).
